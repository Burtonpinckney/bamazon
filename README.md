The following program, known as Bamazon, is a server based application that is a virtual storefront that is designed to simulate an on-line store that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. It is run in the Terminal. To demonstrate see the attached screens shots. The first shows data base listing in mySQL. Note the stock quanity of the Football Helmets, 45.

Below is a screen shot of the program results after being run. Note that 6 Football Helmets were ordered using the assigned ID# at a price of $30.00 a piece. Once the order has been placed the remaining units has been reduced from 45 to 39. The total price of $180.00 is then listed.

The program will also show an "Insufficent Quanity!" message if the customer tries to order more than what is currently available in the store.
